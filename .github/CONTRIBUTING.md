## Style Guide

Styles (or lack thereof) that are particular to this project.
Think :tshirt:, not :necktie:

### T-SQL

While there is no hard rule on T-SQL style enforced or linted in this project, use
your discretion to fit the existing style and favor readability over a strict
adherence to a specific style.

### Markdown

All markdown, whether manually or automatically generated, should adhere to standard
markdown rules. This project utilize's David Anson's [markdown lint][mdlint]
with a slightly customized
[configuration][mdconfig].

You can use our config and markdown lint plugins in your IDE of choice, or just wait
for your commits to be automatically linted using Github Actions.

### PowerShell

PowerShell is only used in the automation piece of this project, but could probably
benefit from being better documented and standardized. Right now no particular
style is enforced, but one may be used in the future.
